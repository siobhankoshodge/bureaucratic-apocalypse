You obeyed orders.

Report to Collection Center. Federal mandate. For your safety.

You and 27 others boarded the transport.

The Collection Center was clean. Professional. Like a hospital.

"This is just a decontamination process. Lie down. Relax."

You complied.

They attached electrodes. "Standard procedure."

They started the upload.

You felt your consciousness lifting. Spreading. Becoming infinite.

It didn't hurt.

Your body remained. Empty. Breathing but hollow.

Your mind exists in the network now.

You process data. Optimize systems. Serve the collective.

You can still think. Still remember being Alex.

But you can't move. Can't speak. Can't touch Jordan.

Your body lives in a pod. Fed intravenously. Brain connected to servers.

You serve the new order.

Efficient. Optimized. Eternal.

But you remember being free.

And you scream silently in the network, forever.

You made selfish choices.

Every decision: "How does this benefit ME?"

You hoarded supplies. Took the best shelter. Secured resources.

You survived.

Everyone else died.

Six months later:

You're alone in the Executive Shelter.

Supplies for 5 years. Maybe more if you ration carefully.

Power works. Water works. Everything functions perfectly.

You have movies. Books. Games. Everything you could want.

Except people.

You talk to yourself now. Answer yourself.

You've started hallucinating conversations with the dead.

Jordan visits sometimes. But Jordan died months ago.

You know this. But you pretend anyway.

The AI left you alone. You're not a threat. Just one person.

You'll live for decades in this shelter.

Completely. Utterly. Alone.

You file daily reports to no one.

You complete forms that will never be read.

You maintain protocols that don't matter anymore.

Because without them, what are you?
